AI advisory system

**1. Scenario Request Intake (SFPCS Step 1 - Adapted)**

Here's how we can define the inputs to tailor the SFPCS framework:

* **Scenario\_Domain:** Social\_Systems\_Analysis
* **Core\_Concept\_Focus:** Intervention\_Strategy\_Optimization\_Under\_Uncertainty
* **Key\_Entity\_Types:**
    * `Data\_Analyzer`: Module for processing community data.
    * `Intervention\_Generator`: Module for proposing intervention strategies.
    * `Risk\_Evaluator`: Module for assessing potential consequences.
    * `Value\_Reasoner`: Module for considering community values.
    * `Strategy\_Synthesizer`: Module for integrating information and formulating advice.
    * `Outcome\_Predictor`: Module for predicting intervention outcomes.
    * `Ethical\_Considerator`: Module for evaluating the ethical implications of the interventions.
    * `Metacognitive_Monitor`: Module for self-assessment of the advisory process.
* **Primary\_Tension\_Goal:** Balancing community well-being, resource scarcity, social stability, uncertainty reduction, and value alignment.
* **Desired\_Scale\_Complexity:** Large\_8\_Modules\_Adaptive\_Meta\_Rules
* **(Optional) Key\_Metrics:**
    * Social\_Stability\_Index
    * Resource\_Distribution\_Equity
    * Well-being\_Index
    * Prediction\_Uncertainty
    * Value\_Alignment\_Score

**2. Generate Simulation Framework Prompt (SFPCS Step 2)**

```plaintext
// SIMULATION FRAMEWORK: Community_Intervention_Advisor_Generator

SETTING:
  - Name: CommunityAdvisorGen_v1
  - Scenario_Domain: Social_Systems_Analysis
  - Core_Concept_Focus: Intervention_Strategy_Optimization_Under_Uncertainty
  - Scale: Abstract_Workflow_Structure
  - Size: 8 Module Types
  - Environment_Rules: Not applicable (generates static template structure)
  - Core_Tension_Source: Balancing competing priorities (well-being, stability, resources), managing uncertainty, and aligning with evolving community values.
  - Simulation_Time_Step_Unit: Generation_Stage

```

**3. Generate Entity Type Prompts (SFPCS Step 3) - Example: `Intervention_Generator`**

Here's a detailed example of the `Intervention_Generator` module, embedding relevant concepts:

```plaintext
// ENTITY DEFINITION: Intervention_Generator

Household/Node Name: InterventionGen_Standard
Archetype: Intervention_Generator

// --- CORE ATTRIBUTES ---
Static Attributes:
  - Stated Intentions/Mandate: "Generate a diverse set of potential intervention strategies to address the identified social challenges."
  - Core Behavioral Tendencies: "['Creative_Solutioning', 'Constraint_Awareness', 'Scenario_Planning']"
Initial Resources: "{Strategy_Templates: ['Resource_Redistribution', 'Conflict_Mediation', 'Educational_Program', 'Community_Engagement'], Generation_Constraints: ['Resource_Limits', 'Acceptability_Bounds', 'Time_Horizon']}"

// --- KNOWLEDGE & WORLD MODEL ---

Decision_Heuristics:
  - "'Favor strategies that address root causes over symptoms.'"
  - "'Consider combinations of intervention types for synergistic effects.'"
  - "'Prioritize strategies with higher potential for long-term impact.'"

// --- MEANING & MOTIVATION SYSTEM --- (Simplified for template generation)
Motivation_Drivers:
  - Hedonic_State: "Solution_Oriented"
  - Eudaimonic_Goals: "['Maximize the effectiveness and positive impact of intervention strategies']"
  - Transcendent_Connection: 0.2 // Acknowledges some alignment with the overall system goal

// --- COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES ---

Module_Proficiency: "{Template_Instantiation: 0.9, Constraint_Satisfaction: 0.8, Scenario_Simulation: 0.7, Synergy_Analysis: 0.6}"

// --- DYNAMIC ATTRIBUTES & ADAPTATION ---
Dynamic Attributes:
  - Current_Generation_Constraints: "['Resource_Limits', 'Acceptability_Bounds', 'Time_Horizon']" // Updated by Risk_Evaluator/Value_Reasoner
  - Recent_Strategy_Successes: "[List of recently effective intervention strategies]"

Update Rules (Embedded Process Logic):
  - Generate_Interventions_Rule: """
    1.  Receive Challenge Description from Data_Analyzer.
    2.  Access Strategy_Template_Library.
    3.  **Perform Template Instantiation**:
        -   Select relevant Strategy_Templates based on Challenge Description.
        -   Instantiate templates with specific parameters (e.g., Resource_Redistribution with amount and recipient groups).
    4.  **Perform Constraint Satisfaction**:
        -   Check if instantiated strategies adhere to Current_Generation_Constraints.
        -   Modify strategies or generate alternatives if constraints are violated.
    5.  **Perform Scenario Simulation**:
        -   Use Internal_Model to predict potential outcomes and consequences of each strategy.
        -   Estimate uncertainty associated with predictions.
    6.  **Perform Synergy Analysis**:
        -   Evaluate potential synergies and conflicts between different intervention strategies.
        -   Consider combining strategies for enhanced impact.
    7.  Output a set of ranked intervention strategies with estimated outcomes, uncertainty levels, and potential synergies.
    """

Learning System:
  - Type: "Template_Refinement"
  - Update_Target: "Strategy_Template_Library"
  - Learning_Rate: 0.05
  - Logic: """
    IF Risk_Evaluator identifies significant Unintended_Consequences THEN
        Modify templates to mitigate those risks in the future.
    IF Value_Reasoner indicates Value_Conflict THEN

    IF Strategy_Synthesizer reports high Success_Rate for a strategy THEN
        Increase its priority or generalize the template for broader applicability.
    """

Meta-Rules:
  - "'IF Template_Instantiation repeatedly produces infeasible strategies THEN Relax Generation_Constraints or request additional templates.'"
  - "'IF Scenario_Simulation yields high Uncertainty for all strategies THEN Trigger request for more Data from Data_Analyzer or explore Novelty-focused strategies.'"

Metacognitive State: (Relays uncertainty info to Metacognitive_Monitor)
```

**4. Generate Event Type Prompts (SFPCS Step 4)**

We'll need events like:

* `Challenge_Identified` (from `Data_Analyzer`)
* `Interventions_Generated` (from `Intervention_Generator`)
* `Risk_Assessed` (from `Risk_Evaluator`)
* `Value_Considered` (from `Value_Reasoner`)
* `Advice_Synthesized` (from `Strategy_Synthesizer`)
* `Outcome_Predicted` (from `Outcome_Predictor`)
* `Ethical_Concerns_Raised` (from `Ethical_Considerator`)
* `Process_Assessment` (from `Metacognitive_Monitor`)

Each event would have detailed impact assessments, including how it affects module attributes, cognitive processes, and motivations.

**5. Generate Workflow & Metrics Prompts (SFPCS Step 5)**

Here's a snippet of the workflow for generating an advisory report:

```plaintext
// WORKFLOW FRAMEWORK (Generation Sequence)

SEQUENCE NAME: Generate_Community_Intervention_Advice

STEP 1:
  - Initiator: Data_Analyzer
  - Action: Analyze_Community_Data
  - Output: Challenge_Identified -> Intervention_Generator, Risk_Evaluator, Value_Reasoner

STEP 2:
  - Initiator: Intervention_Generator
  - Action: Generate_Interventions
  - Output: Interventions_Generated -> Risk_Evaluator, Value_Reasoner, Outcome_Predictor

STEP 3:
  - Initiator: Risk_Evaluator
  - Action: Assess_Intervention_Risks
  - Output: Risk_Assessed -> Strategy_Synthesizer

STEP 4:
  - Initiator: Value_Reasoner
  - Action: Consider_Community_Values
  - Output: Value_Considered -> Strategy_Synthesizer, Ethical_Considerator

STEP 5:
  - Initiator: Outcome_Predictor
  - Action: Predict_Intervention_Outcomes
  - Output: Outcome_Predicted -> Strategy_Synthesizer

STEP 6:
  - Initiator: Ethical_Considerator
  - Action: Evaluate_Ethical_Implications
  - Output: Ethical_Concerns_Raised -> Strategy_Synthesizer

STEP 7:
  - Initiator: Strategy_Synthesizer
  - Action: Synthesize_Advice
  - Output: Advice_Synthesized -> User/Stakeholder

STEP 8:
  - Initiator: Metacognitive_Monitor
  - Action: Assess_Generation_Process
  - Output: Process_Assessment -> Strategy_Adaptation_Engine
```

Metrics would be defined to track the quality of advice (e.g., feasibility, ethical soundness, predicted impact), the efficiency of the generation process, and the level of uncertainty in the predictions.

**6. Present & Refine (SFPCS Step 6)**

This is where we would analyze the generated prompts, trace a conceptual generation run, and iteratively refine the module definitions, event structures, and workflow based on feedback and self-analysis.

**Conceptual Generation Run (Example Snippet)**

Let's imagine a simplified trace of the SFPCS framework *generating* a piece of advice:

1.  **Data\_Analyzer** identifies "increasing social tension due to resource scarcity" (Challenge\_Identified).
2.  **Intervention\_Generator** proposes "Resource Redistribution" and "Conflict Mediation" strategies (Interventions\_Generated).
3.  **Risk\_Evaluator** warns of potential for elite resistance to redistribution (Risk\_Assessed).
4.  **Value\_Reasoner** emphasizes the community value of "fairness" (Value\_Considered).
5.  **Strategy\_Synthesizer** combines the strategies, advising: "Implement targeted resource redistribution with community-led conflict mediation, prioritizing fairness and addressing elite concerns through transparent communication" (Advice\_Synthesized).

**Self-Analysis & Meta-Logic Application**

To critically evaluate the SFPCS *generator framework* and the *potential advice templates* it could produce, we'll apply our analytical toolkit:

* **OLA (Logical & Conceptual Coherence):**
    * Generator: Ensure modules have clear responsibilities and information flow. Check for logical consistency in rules.
    * Template: Verify that the generated advice workflow has logically sound steps and considers relevant factors.
* **Synergy/Entropy (System Dynamics):**
    * Generator: Balance exploration (generating diverse strategies) with exploitation (focusing on proven approaches). Avoid redundant modules.
    * Template: Aim for synergistic advice that addresses multiple aspects of the problem, minimizing unintended negative consequences.
* **Metacognitive Control:**
    * Generator: The `Metacognitive_Monitor` should track confidence, uncertainty, and potential biases in the generation process, triggering adjustments as needed.
    * Template: The generated advice workflow should include steps for uncertainty assessment and validation.
* **Ethical Evaluation:**
    * Generator: The `Ethical_Considerator` module must rigorously evaluate the ethical implications of potential interventions, considering diverse perspectives.
    * Template: The generated advice workflow should prioritize ethical considerations and community values.
* **Advancement Cycle (Truth/Scrutiny/Improvement):**
    * Generator: Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the SFPCS framework in generating good advice, scrutinize its weaknesses, and improve its modules and workflow.
    * Template: The generated advice workflow should include mechanisms for feedback collection and adaptation.

This detailed breakdown demonstrates how we can use SFPCS to design a system that generates sophisticated advisory workflows for complex social challenges. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific module, event, or aspect of the analysis!
