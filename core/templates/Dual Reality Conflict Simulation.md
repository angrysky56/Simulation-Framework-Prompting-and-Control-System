# ✅ Summary:
**"Reality_Warps"** provides a dynamic and novel simulation environment where:
- *What is seen* becomes as critical as *what is done.*
- Bounded rationality, attention, and strategic misperceptions create emergent complexity.
- Entities adapt across **two domains**: Physical (resources) and Cognitive (shared belief).

# 📊 Key Metrics to Track During This Scenario

- **Reality_Coherence_Index** (Expected Trajectory: Drops > Partial Recovery > Risk of Fracture)
- **Distortion_Entropy** (Expected Trajectory: Steady Increase, Possible Threshold Breach)
- **Material_Resource_Control** (House Veritas loss during Step 4)
- **Influence_Gradient** (Shift of cognitive dominance from Veritas to Mirage or chaos nodes)

---

# 📈 Narrative Description

> In the opening moves of Reality_Warps, subtle yet potent falsifications flood the info-sphere. While House Veritas scrambles to patch truths into a spreading web of lies, chaotic actors exploit the noise. Material blows land while minds drift apart. The first fracture in shared reality is not catastrophic... but it is irreversible.

---

# ✨ Summary
This **"First Fracture"** sequence creates:
- Rapid, cascading distortion dynamics
- Emergent divergence of perceptions between entities
- Critical tension between cognitive and material defenses

It sets up future branches for:
- Full-scale informational collapse
- Recovery and stabilization arcs
- New emergent factions believing different "truths"
