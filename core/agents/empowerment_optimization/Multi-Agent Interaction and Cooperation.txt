11. Group Cooperation:
    - Encourage cooperation by adjusting the reward function to include the group's total empowerment:
      r_i = (1 - λ) * E_i + λ * E_group
    - Agents balance their own empowerment with the overall group performance by controlling λ (cooperation factor)

12. Communication and Coordination:
    - Agents can share limited information, such as their predicted future states or empowerment estimates
    - Use this information to adjust individual policies to avoid conflicts or overlap in actions
