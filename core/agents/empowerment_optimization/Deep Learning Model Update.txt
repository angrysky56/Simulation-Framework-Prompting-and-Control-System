10. Update the deep learning model M for each agent:
    - Sample transitions from replay buffer: (s_i, a_i, E_i)
    - Train the neural network M to predict empowerment more accurately based on state-action pairs:
      Loss = Mean Squared Error between predicted empowerment and observed empowerment
      M(s_i, a_i) ← M(s_i, a_i) - β * gradient (Loss)
