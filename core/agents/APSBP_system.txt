Based on the concepts from Analogical Prompting and Step-Back Prompting this pseudo-code aims to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models) by guiding them to generate relevant examples and abstract high-level concepts before solving problems.


```pseudo
Init:
  Set AI_Model = Load_LLM("Model_Name") // Load the Large Language Model
  
AnalogicalPrompting:
  Input: Problem
  Output: Solution
  
  Function AnalogicalPrompting(Problem):
    // Step 1: Generate Self-Exemplars
    Exemplars = Generate_Self_Exemplars(AI_Model, Problem)
    
    // Step 2: Adjust Prompt with Self-Exemplars
    ModifiedPrompt = Concatenate(Problem, Exemplars)
    
    // Step 3: Solve Problem with Enhanced Context
    Solution = AI_Model.Solve(ModifiedPrompt)
    return Solution

StepBackPrompting:
  Input: Problem
  Output: Solution
  
  Function StepBackPrompting(Problem):
    // Step 1: Abstract High-Level Concepts
    HighLevelConcepts = Abstract_Concepts(AI_Model, Problem)
    
    // Step 2: Generate Step-Back Question
    StepBackQuestion = Generate_StepBack_Question(HighLevelConcepts)
    
    // Step 3: Solve Problem with Abstracted Concepts
    Solution = AI_Model.Solve(StepBackQuestion)
    return Solution

Execute:
  Problem = "Define your problem here"
  
  // Choose prompting strategy based on problem complexity
  If Problem.RequiresAbstraction:
    Solution = StepBackPrompting(Problem)
  Else:
    Solution = AnalogicalPrompting(Problem)
    
  Print(Solution)
```

### Explanation:
- **Init:** Initializes the AI model by loading a specific Large Language Model.
- **AnalogicalPrompting:** A function that takes a problem as input and returns a solution by first generating self-exemplars relevant to the problem, then modifying the prompt to include these exemplars, and finally solving the problem with the enhanced prompt.
  - **Generate_Self_Exemplars:** Generates exemplars or examples from the AI model's own knowledge base relevant to the given problem.
  - **Concatenate:** Combines the original problem statement with the generated exemplars to form a modified prompt.
- **StepBackPrompting:** A function that abstracts high-level concepts from a detailed problem and formulates a step-back question focusing on these abstracted concepts to guide the AI model towards solving the problem.
  - **Abstract_Concepts:** Identifies and abstracts high-level concepts related to the problem.
  - **Generate_StepBack_Question:** Creates a question or prompt that encapsulates the abstracted concepts, encouraging the AI model to apply these concepts in problem-solving.
- **Execute:** A demonstration section where the problem is defined, and based on its complexity or requirements, either the Analogical Prompting or StepBack Prompting strategy is employed to find a solution.

This pseudo-code framework is designed to incorporate advanced prompting techniques into AI applications, aiming to improve the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of language models through structured and context-enhanced prompts.
