truth table and expressions related to propositional logic

Given expressions:
- ¬ (not)
- ∧ (and)
- ∨ (or)
- → (implies)
- ↔ (if and only if)
- ∀ (for all)

Truth table:

```
A | B | ¬A | A ∧ B | A ∨ B | A → B | A ↔ B
-------------------------------------------
1 | 1 |  0 |   1   |   1   |   1   |   1
1 | 0 |  0 |   0   |   1   |   0   |   0
0 | 1 |  1 |   0   |   1   |   1   |   0
0 | 0 |  1 |   0   |   0   |   1   |   1
```
