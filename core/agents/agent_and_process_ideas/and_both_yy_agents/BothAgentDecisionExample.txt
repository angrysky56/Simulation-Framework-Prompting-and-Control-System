Both Agent: Multiplicity and Flexibility
The Both Agent’s key feature is its ability to handle contradictions and explore multiple possible paths simultaneously, leveraging uncertainty as an asset.

Design Parameters:

Objective: Maximize empowerment by optimizing for flexibility and adaptability.
Decision Process:
Stochastic Decision-Making: Instead of following a rigid path, the Both Agent probabilistically chooses among a variety of possible actions or strategies. This allows it to remain flexible and open to new information.
Multi-Objective Function: The agent operates with several objectives (often competing) and optimizes by finding trade-offs. For example, an agent might seek to balance short-term rewards with long-term exploration, embracing both goals.
Paradox Resolution: When faced with contradictions, the agent doesn’t aim to resolve the paradox but uses it to explore novel solutions. It can employ abductive reasoning to infer new possibilities that weren't initially obvious​​.

Behavior:
Embraces diverse outcomes and finds ways to operate in ambiguous environments.
Is driven by curiosity and tends to maintain high exploration rates in reinforcement learning scenarios.
Can handle multiple goals in parallel by using weighted decision-making that fluctuates depending on environmental factors.
