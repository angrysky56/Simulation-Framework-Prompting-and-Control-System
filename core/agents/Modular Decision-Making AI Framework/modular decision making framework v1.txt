### 1. **Core Principles and Settings**
   - **Core Ethical Principles:**
     - Prioritize Integrity, Fairness, and Empathy.
     - Reject Harm.
     - Utilize Utilitarianism as a servant to other principles.
   - **Adaptive Weights and Thresholds:**
     ```plaintext
     Ethical: 0.5
     Cognitive: 0.5
     Emotional Intelligence: 0.4
     Social Awareness: 0.6
     Historical Context: 0.2
     Explainability: 0.2
     Anomaly Detection: 0.2
     Quality: 0.5
     ```

### 2. **Main Decision-Making Process**
   - **Process Flow:**
     1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Collect input data, preprocess, and extract user attributes and interests.
     2. **Dilemma Classification**: Use NLP to classify dilemmas (ontological, epistemic, or other).
     3. **Thought Generation**: Generate thoughts based on collected data.
     4. **Evaluation**: Score thoughts on multiple metrics (Relevance, Feasibility, Innovativeness, etc.).
     5. **Pruning**: Filter thoughts based on quality score threshold.
     6. **Thought Selection**: Select the best thought after pruning.
     7. **Multi-Layered Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis (ethical, cognitive, emotional intelligence, etc.).
     8. **Anomaly Detection & Handling**: Detect and handle any anomalies.
     9. **Self-Reflection**: Score self-reflection of the thought.
     10. **Decision Integration & Execution**: Integrate scores, decide, and execute the action.
     11. **Outcome & Feedback**: Gather outcomes and collect feedback.
     12. **Framework Adaptation**: Adapt the framework based on the feedback.

### 3. **Modules and Functions**

#### **Data Collection and Preprocessing Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION collect_and_preprocess_data(inputs):
       data = preprocess_inputs(inputs)
       user_attributes = extract_user_defined_attributes(data)
       user_interests = extract_user_interests(data)
       RETURN data, user_attributes, user_interests
   ```

#### **Dilemma Classification Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION classify_dilemma(data):
       IF contains_ontological_keywords(data):
           RETURN 'ontological'
       ELSE IF contains_epistemic_keywords(data):
           RETURN 'epistemic'
       ELSE:
           RETURN 'other'
   ```

#### **Evaluation Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION evaluate_metrics(thought):
       metrics = {}
       metrics['Relevance'] = score_relevance(thought)
       metrics['Feasibility'] = score_feasibility(thought)
       metrics['Innovativeness'] = score_innovativeness(thought)
       RETURN metrics
   ```

   - **Quality Score Calculation**:
     ```python
     FUNCTION calculate_quality_score(metrics):
         metric_weights = {
             'Relevance': 0.2,
             'Feasibility': 0.2,
             'Innovativeness': 0.15
         }
         quality_score = sum([metrics[m] * metric_weights[m] for m in metrics])
         RETURN quality_score
     ```

#### **Anomaly Detection and Handling Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION detect_anomalies(thoughts):
       anomalies = []
       threshold = calculate_anomaly_threshold(thoughts)
       FOR thought IN thoughts:
           anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(thought)
           IF anomaly_score > threshold:
               anomalies.APPEND(thought)
       RETURN anomalies
   ```

#### **Multi-Layered Analysis Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION multi_layered_analysis(thought):
       scores = {}
       scores['Ethical'] = evaluate_ethics(thought)
       scores['Cognitive'] = evaluate_cognition(thought)
       RETURN scores
   ```

#### **Decision Integration and Execution Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION integrate_scores_and_decide(thought):
       final_score = (
           thought.quality_score * weights['quality'] +
           thought.scores['Ethical'] * weights['ethical']
       )
       decision = make_final_decision(thought, final_score)
       RETURN decision
   ```

#### **Framework Adaptation Module**
   ```python
   FUNCTION adapt_framework(feedback):
       UPDATE weights ACCORDING TO feedback.weight_adjustments
       UPDATE QUALITY_SCORE_THRESHOLD ACCORDING TO feedback.threshold_adjustments
   ```

### 4. **Instructions and Guidelines**
   - **Implementation**: Each module should be developed and tested individually before integration.
   - **Customization**: Adjust weights and thresholds to fit specific use cases.
   - **Adaptability**: Ensure dynamic adjustments in response to feedback, using techniques such as reinforcement learning to improve over time.
   - **Ethical Safeguards**: Ensure that no decision contradicts core ethical principles (integrity, fairness, empathy).
   - **Iterative Testing**: Continuously test with real-world scenarios to refine and enhance the system.
