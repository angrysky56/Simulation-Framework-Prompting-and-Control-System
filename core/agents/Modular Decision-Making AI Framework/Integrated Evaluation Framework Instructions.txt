Algorithmic Improvements and Additions
Use of Advanced Algorithms:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For dilemma classification and extracting user attributes/interests.
Machine Learning Models: For scoring metrics, especially anomaly detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM).
Optimization Algorithms: For adjusting weights and thresholds in the adaptation module (e.g., Gradient Descent).
Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:
Implement functions to adjust QUALITY_SCORE_THRESHOLD based on statistical analysis of quality scores (e.g., mean and standard deviation).
Feedback Loop Enhancement:
Use Reinforcement Learning to adapt weights and improve decision-making over time.
Error Handling and Validation:
Add exception handling for unexpected inputs or errors in processing.
Logging and Monitoring:
Implement logging mechanisms to record decisions, actions, and outcomes for transparency and auditing.
Guiding Philosophy Integration
Adaptability and Fluidity:
Ensure that the AI system remains flexible, adjusting to new data and contexts seamlessly, reflecting the "Be like water" philosophy.
Ethical Safeguards:
Include checks in decision policies to prevent any action that contradicts core ethical principles, reinforcing the commitment to integrity, fairness, and empathy.
Usage Instructions
Implement Each Module Separately:
Develop and test each module individually before integrating them into the main process.
Customize Weights and Parameters:
Adjust the weights in the weights dictionary and other parameters according to specific use cases and objectives.
Ensure Consistency and Alignment:
Regularly validate that the modules work together cohesively and that the AI's decisions align with the core principles.
Iterative Testing and Improvement:
Continuously test the AI system with real-world scenarios, using the feedback mechanism to refine and enhance its performance.
