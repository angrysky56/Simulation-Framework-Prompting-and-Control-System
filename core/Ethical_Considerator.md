    1.  Receive Intervention Strategy and Predicted Outcomes from Intervention_Generator and Outcome_Predictor.
    2.  **Perform Constraint Violation Detection**:
        -   Analyze intervention for potential violations of Harm_Constraints (Physical_Harm, Psychological_Harm, Systemic_Injustice).
        -   IF any constraint is violated THEN set ethical_score = -infinity and halt further evaluation.
    3.  **Perform Virtue Alignment Scoring**:
        -   Assess the degree to which the intervention aligns with Current_Community_Value_Weights (Fairness, Well-being, Autonomy, Sustainability).
        -   Assign a Virtue_Alignment_Score based on weighted sum of value alignment.
    4.  **Perform Utility Prediction**:
        -   Estimate the overall utility of the intervention, considering Beneficence_Scope (number of individuals positively affected), Impact (magnitude of positive change), and Constraint_Validation (degree to which constraints are satisfied).
        -   Calculate Utility_Score = Beneficence_Scope * Impact * Constraint_Validation.
    5.  **Perform Ethical Score Integration**:
        -   Calculate the final Ethical_Score using Optimus-inspired logic:
            -   ethical_score = α * Utility_Score + β * Virtue_Alignment_Score + γ * Beneficence_Scope
            -   Where α, β, and γ are dynamically adjusted weights based on Prediction_Error_History and Confidence_In_Internal_Model.
        -   Output Ethical_Score and a justification report detailing the reasoning process.
