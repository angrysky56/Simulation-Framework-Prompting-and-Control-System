# Simulation Framework Prompting and Control System (SFPCS)

Welcome to the **Simulation Framework Prompting and Control System (SFPCS)**! This project provides a structured, dynamic method to design, adapt, run, and analyze complex simulation scenarios using modular prompts and agent definitions. SFPCS was created to help researchers, developers, educators, and strategists simulate evolving systems with rich agent behavior and emergent dynamics.

Developed with inspiration from the [Simulation Prompting and Control System Custom GPT by angrysky56](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-681022d6c0508191835289e2e31736a5-simulation-framework-prompting-and-control-system).

## ‚ú® Real-World Applications

SFPCS can be applied to a wide range of domains:

### Policy Simulation & Geopolitical Risk Analysis
Model alliances, conflicts, sanctions, arms races, and crisis escalation dynamics.

### Business Strategy & Competitive Markets
Test different pricing strategies, innovation races, and consumer behavior models.

### Organizational Dynamics & Leadership Training
Explore how internal communication, factionalism, or leadership styles influence group outcomes.

### Disaster Response & Crisis Management
Simulate decentralized responses to pandemics, cyberattacks, natural disasters.

### Social Dynamics & Ethics Research
Study polarization, systemic bias, moral decision-making, and societal resilience.

### AI/AGI Safety and Agent Testing
Evaluate learning agents, test cognitive modules, study emergence of misalignment.

### Educational Simulations
Create serious games for history, economics, ethics, and civic education.

### Urban Planning and Resource Management
Model urban traffic, migration, zoning, and infrastructure impact under stress.

## üí° How SFPCS Works

1. **Scenario Intake**: Define domain, focus, entities, tension, scale, and metrics.
2. **Framework Prompt Generation**: Build the environment, tensions, and goals.
3. **Entity Type Prompting**: Define agent types with rich cognitive, motivational, and dynamic systems.
4. **Event Type Prompting**: Create modular, domain-specific events that affect entities.
5. **Workflow & Metric Definition**: Set event sequences, conditional logic, and evaluation metrics.
6. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously improve by feedback loops, self-analysis, and scenario evolution.

## üìä Demo Example

### Global Village Simulation (Geopolitical Tensions)

**Setting**: A "global village" of 10 "households" representing different nations.
- Some households have "special weapons" (nuclear analogues).
- Significant power imbalances, mistrust, limited resources.

**Entity Types**:
- Aggressive Superpowers (e.g., "House Americana")
- Internally Controlling Households (e.g., dictatorship analogues)
- Oppressed/Confined Households (e.g., occupied territories)
- Fearful Neutral Neighbors
- Individuals within oppressive households seeking autonomy

**Events**:
- Economic Actions: Sanctions, aid, blockades.
- Military Actions: Threats, skirmishes, arms buildup.
- Diplomatic Actions: Treaties, condemnations, alliances.
- Internal Actions: Protests, resource reallocations, leadership changes.

**Metrics**:
- Conflict Index
- Alliance Stability
- Civilian Wellbeing Score
- Resource Access Inequality

**Sample Workflow**:
1. House Sino imposes a blockade on House Palestinia.
2. House Neutralis protests diplomatically.
3. House Americana threatens House Sino with sanctions.
4. Internal dissent rises in House Palestinia, triggering a protest event.

**Goal**: See whether the village escalates into collapse, stabilizes through diplomacy, or experiences internal revolutions.
